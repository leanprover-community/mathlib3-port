# The topological dual of a normed space

In this file we define the topological dual `normed_space.dual` of a normed space, and the
continuous linear map `normed_space.inclusion_in_double_dual` from a normed space into its double
dual.

For base field `𝕜 = ℝ` or `𝕜 = ℂ`, this map is actually an isometric embedding; we provide a
version `normed_space.inclusion_in_double_dual_li` of the map which is of type a bundled linear
isometric embedding, `E →ₗᵢ[𝕜] (dual 𝕜 (dual 𝕜 E))`.

Since a lot of elementary properties don't require `eq_of_dist_eq_zero` we start setting up the
theory for `semi_normed_space` and we specialize to `normed_space` when needed.
