# Support of the derivative of a function

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

In this file we prove that the (topological) support of a function includes the support of its
derivative. As a corollary, we show that the derivative of a function with compact support has
compact support.
