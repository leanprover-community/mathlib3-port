# Free algebras

Given a semiring `R` and a type `X`, we construct the free non-unital, non-associative algebra on
`X` with coefficients in `R`, together with its universal property. The construction is valuable
because it can be used to build free algebras with more structure, e.g., free Lie algebras.

Note that elsewhere we have a construction of the free unital, associative algebra. This is called
`free_algebra`.

## Main definitions

  * `free_non_unital_non_assoc_algebra`
  * `free_non_unital_non_assoc_algebra.lift`
  * `free_non_unital_non_assoc_algebra.of`

## Implementation details

We construct the free algebra as the magma algebra, with coefficients in `R`, of the free magma on
`X`. However we regard this as an implementation detail and thus deliberately omit the lemmas
`of_apply` and `lift_apply`, and we mark `free_non_unital_non_assoc_algebra` and `lift` as
irreducible once we have established the universal property.
