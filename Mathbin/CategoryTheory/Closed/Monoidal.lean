# Closed monoidal categories

Define (right) closed objects and (right) closed monoidal categories.

## TODO
Some of the theorems proved about cartesian closed categories
should be generalised and moved to this file.

The unit object is always closed.
This isn't an instance because most of the time we'll prove closedness for all objects at once,
rather than just for this one.
