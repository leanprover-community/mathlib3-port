# Preadditive monoidal categories

A monoidal category is `monoidal_preadditive` if it is preadditive and tensor product of morphisms
is linear in both factors.

A category is `monoidal_preadditive` if tensoring is linear in both factors.

Note we don't `extend preadditive C` here, as `abelian C` already extends it,
and we'll need to have both typeclasses sometimes.
