# Thin categories

A thin category (also known as a sparse category) is a category with at most one morphism between
each pair of objects.

Examples include posets, but also some indexing categories (diagrams) for special shapes of
(co)limits.

To construct a category instance one only needs to specify the `category_struct` part,
as the axioms hold for free.

If `C` is thin, then the category of functors to `C` is also thin.
Further, to show two objects are isomorphic in a thin category, it suffices only to give a morphism
in each direction.
