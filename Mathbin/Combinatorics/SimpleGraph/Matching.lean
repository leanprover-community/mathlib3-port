# Matchings


## Main definitions

* a `matching` on a simple graph is a subset of its edge set such that
   no two edges share an endpoint.

* a `perfect_matching` on a simple graph is a matching in which every
   vertex belongs to an edge.

TODO:
  - Lemma stating that the existence of a perfect matching on `G` implies that
    the cardinality of `V` is even (assuming it's finite)
  - Hall's Marriage Theorem (see combinatorics.hall)
  - Tutte's Theorem
  - consider coercions instead of type definition for `matching`:
    https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/5156#discussion_r532935457
  - consider expressing `matching_verts` as union:
    https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/5156#discussion_r532906131

TODO: Tutte and Hall require a definition of subgraphs.
