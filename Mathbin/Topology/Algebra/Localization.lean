# Localization of topological rings

> THIS FILE IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH MATHLIB4.
> Any changes to this file require a corresponding PR to mathlib4.

The topological localization of a topological commutative ring `R` at a submonoid `M` is the ring
`localization M`  endowed with the final ring topology of the natural homomorphism sending `x : R`
to the equivalence class of `(x, 1)` in the localization of `R` at a `M`.

## Main Results

- `localization.topological_ring`: The localization of a topological commutative ring at a submonoid
  is a topological ring.
