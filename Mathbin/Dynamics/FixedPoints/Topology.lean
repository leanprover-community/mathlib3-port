# Topological properties of fixed points

Currently this file contains two lemmas:

- `is_fixed_pt_of_tendsto_iterate`: if `f^n(x) ‚Üí y` and `f` is continuous at `y`, then `f y = y`;
- `is_closed_fixed_points`: the set of fixed points of a continuous map is a closed set.

## TODO

fixed points, iterates
