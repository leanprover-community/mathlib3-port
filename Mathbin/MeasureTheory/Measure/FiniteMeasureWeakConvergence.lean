# Weak convergence of (finite) measures

This file will define the topology of weak convergence of finite measures and probability measures
on topological spaces. The topology of weak convergence is the coarsest topology w.r.t. which
for every bounded continuous `ℝ≥0`-valued function `f`, the integration of `f` against the
measure is continuous.

TODOs:
* Define the topologies (the current version only defines the types) via
  `weak_dual ℝ≥0 (α →ᵇ ℝ≥0)`.
* Prove that an equivalent definition of the topologies is obtained requiring continuity of
  integration of bounded continuous `ℝ`-valued functions instead.
* Include the portmanteau theorem on characterizations of weak convergence of (Borel) probability
  measures.

## Main definitions

The main definitions are the types `finite_measure α` and `probability_measure α`.

TODO:
* Define the topologies on the above types.

## Main results

None yet.

TODO:
* Portmanteau theorem.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

The topology of weak convergence of finite Borel measures will be defined using a mapping from
`finite_measure α` to `weak_dual ℝ≥0 (α →ᵇ ℝ≥0)`, inheriting the topology from the latter.

The current implementation of `finite_measure α` and `probability_measure α` is directly as
subtypes of `measure α`, and the coercion to a function is the composition `ennreal.to_nnreal`
and the coercion to function of `measure α`. Another alternative would be to use a bijection
with `vector_measure α ℝ≥0` as an intermediate step. The choice of implementation should not have
drastic downstream effects, so it can be changed later if appropriate.

Potential advantages of using the `nnreal`-valued vector measure alternative:
 * The coercion to function would avoid need to compose with `ennreal.to_nnreal`, the
   `nnreal`-valued API could be more directly available.
Potential drawbacks of the vector measure alternative:
 * The coercion to function would lose monotonicity, as non-measurable sets would be defined to
   have measure 0.
 * No integration theory directly. E.g., the topology definition requires `lintegral` w.r.t.
   a coercion to `measure α` in any case.
